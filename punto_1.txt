Point 1 is developed in the file "matrix.py"

In short, the eigenvalues of A'A and AA' are the same, and the corresponding eigenvectors 
can be obtained from the eigenvectors of A and A'. Also, the corresponding eigenvectors are 
perpendicular to each other, which means that if x is an eigenvector of A'A and y is a corresponding eigenvector of AA', 
then x and y are orthogonal (x'y=0)
