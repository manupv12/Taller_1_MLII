UMAP is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method that
seeks to take the data to a space of smaller dimensions and be able to visualize it.
It has 3 key principles that are:

The data is uniformly distributed on a Riemannian manifold.

The Riemannian metric is locally constant (or can be approximated as such).

The variety is locally connected.
